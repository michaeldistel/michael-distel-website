			This site is mostly for me, a quiet place to gather ideas, notes, and half-finished thoughts.
			Making it public is partly a psychological trick, knowing that someone might be reading gives
			me pause to think my ideas through more fully, to stop being lazy with my thoughts. If anyone
			else reads it (hi Mum), that is a pleasant surprise rather than the goal.

			You will find a mix of things: projects I am working on, small tools and experiments, and
			updates on a VS Code extension I am building at <a
				href="https://controlforge.dev"
				target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer"
				class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline">controlforge.dev</a
			>. Some topics come up a lot for me: early-stage investing and what actually moves a company
			forward, Web3 with a focus on testing and stablecoins as practical rails, industrial
			automation where small workflow tweaks can save surprising effort.

		<p class="mb-6 md:text-xl sm:text-base">
			There is a personal side too. I enjoy slow travel and small adventures, like kick-scooting
			1,800 km across Japan with friends. I keep notes on rockets and the physics that make them
			fly, plus the odd entry about motorbikes or games. You may see these topics here, or maybe
			not.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-6 md:text-xl sm:text-base">
			Most entries will be short, occasionally messy, and sometimes wrong. I will update or retract
			things as I learn, dates matter here, context changes, and I would rather show the thinking
			than pretend I always knew the answer.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-6 md:text-xl sm:text-base">
			If you have stumbled in and something resonates, that is great. If not, that is fine too. This
			is more scrapbook than manifesto, a place to think in public, quietly.
