			This site is mostly for me, a quiet place to gather ideas, notes, and half-finished thoughts.
			I am not chasing polish here. I want somewhere I can return to when a thread pops back up
			months later, a simple record of what I was thinking and building at the time. If anyone else
			reads it (hi Mum), that is a pleasant surprise rather than the goal.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-6 md:text-xl sm:text-base">
			You will find a mix of things: projects I am working on, small tools and experiments, and
			updates on a VS Code extension I am building at <a
				href="https://controlforge.dev"
				target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer"
				class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline">controlforge.dev</a
			>. I will also park ideas I am testing in the open, things that might become something or
			might not, so I do not lose them.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-6 md:text-xl sm:text-base">
			Some topics come up a lot for me. Early-stage investing and what actually moves a company
			forward. Web3 with a focus on testing and stablecoins as practical rails. Industrial
			automation, where small workflow tweaks can save a surprising amount of effort. I like simple
			systems that make everyday work calmer and faster.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-6 md:text-xl sm:text-base">
			There is a personal side too. I enjoy slow travel and small adventures, like kick-scooting
			1,800 km across Japan with friends. I keep notes on rockets and the physics that make them
			fly, and the odd entry about motorbikes or games. It is a scrapbook more than a manifesto.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-6 md:text-xl sm:text-base">
			Most entries will be short, occasionally messy, and sometimes wrong. I will update or retract
			things as I learn. Dates matter here. Context changes, and I would rather show the thinking
			than pretend I always knew the answer.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-6 md:text-xl sm:text-base">
			If you have stumbled in and something resonates, that is great. If not, that is fine too. This
			is mainly a working notebook, a place to think in public, quietly.
