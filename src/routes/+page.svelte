	<p class="mb-6 md:text-xl sm:text-base">
		I’ve been calling Singapore home since 2005. When I first arrived, I had little more than a few
		dreams and a backpack, no job, just the hope of building a life here. Not long after settling
		in, I spent time at Citect (2006–2008) and then
		<a

		>
		(2008–2011), developing critical software for power plants and water treatment facilities. In late
		2006, Schneider Electric offered to acquire Citect in a deal valued at around A$287 million, and
		by 2008, the acquisition was complete. Although it wasn’t as flashy as Web3 or AI, I grew to appreciate
		the precision and attention to detail required in those projects. Eventually, though, I realized
		the slower pace of corporate life wasn’t for me, so I began seeking out more dynamic, fast-paced
		environments.

		That’s when I co-founded Feel Beautiful (2011–2016) with Michelle Yang (<a

			class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline">feelbeautiful.com.sg</a
		>. We grew to around twenty people, selling into multiple countries, and I learned a lot about
		finance, business models, online marketing, and the daily logistics of running a trading
		company. After that, I took on freelance consulting projects (2017–2021) and served as an
		Interim CTO for hire (2020–2021), helping startups with technology and growth. It was also my
		introduction to Web3: I built a Bitcoin exchange for a private bank in Australia and contributed
		to other crypto focused ventures.

		2021 led by

		invoices, saving its customers nearly S$40 million in 2021 alone. In February 2023, FoodRazor
		was acquired by

		firsthand insight into how investors evaluate startups, review pitch decks, and discover what
		drives entrepreneurs. Around that same period, I also joined

	<p class="mb-6 md:text-xl sm:text-base">
		When I’m not juggling startup operations, analyzing data, or imagining the next leap in space
		travel, I enjoy meeting people who share an enthusiasm for new ideas. Even a simple conversation
		can bring a fresh perspective, and that sense of discovery is what makes life in Singapore, and
		life in general so fulfilling.

		If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to hear from you, whether it’s to grab a coffee,
		collaborate on a project, or simply say hello. And if you ever spot me at an event, please feel
		free to come up, share your story, and say hi. I’m always happy to meet new faces and learn
		about different journeys.
