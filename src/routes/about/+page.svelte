		Writing about yourself feels strange. There is something inherently awkward about summarising a
		life in a few paragraphs, deciding which parts matter and which to leave out. But this page is
		not really for anyone else. It is a place for me to reflect and think about my journey so far,
		to see the connections between different chapters and notice what patterns emerge. It is not
		complete, and it will probably change, but it is honest enough for now.

	<p class="mb-6 md:text-xl sm:text-base">
		I have been calling Singapore home since 2005. When I first arrived, I had little more than a
		few dreams and a backpack, no job, just the hope of building something here. Not long after
		settling in, I found work at Citect (2006–2008) and then
		<a

		>
		(2008–2011), writing software for power plants and water treatment facilities. Schneider acquired
		Citect in 2008 for around A$287 million. The work was not as flashy as Web3 or AI, but I learned
		to appreciate the precision required when things absolutely cannot fail. Eventually, though, the
		slower pace did not suit me, and I started looking for something different.

	<h3 class="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Early Ventures</h3>
	<p class="mb-6 md:text-xl sm:text-base">
		In 2011, I co-founded Feel Beautiful, importing skincare products across Southeast Asia. It
		sounds simple but taught me about logistics, compliance, and the daily reality of running a
		business. The company continues at
		<a
			href="https://feelbeautiful.com.sg"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener noreferrer"
			class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline">feelbeautiful.com.sg</a
		>. We grew to around twenty people across multiple countries. I learned more about finance and
		operations than I expected. After that, I did freelance consulting (2017–2021) and worked as an
		interim CTO, helping startups with technology questions. This was also when I first encountered
		Web3, building a Bitcoin exchange for a private bank in Australia and working on other crypto
		projects.

		until 2020, working on restaurant back-end systems. The company raised S$900k in 2021 led by

			rel="noopener noreferrer"
			class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline">Cocoon Capital</a

		acquired by

			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener noreferrer"
			class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline">OrderEZ</a
		> in February 2023. I had the opportunity to join Cocoon Capital as an Investment Associate (2021–2024),
		the same firm that had led FoodRazor's investment. This let me sit on the other side of the table
		and learn about timing, founder-market fit, and how much of early-stage investing comes down to signals
		versus stories.

		without the usual complexity. At the moment, I do not have anything solid planned and am hunting
		around for the next thing to do. I am curious about what problems are worth solving and where I might
		be useful.
