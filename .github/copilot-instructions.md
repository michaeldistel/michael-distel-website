# Copilot Instructions for Michael Distel's Website

## Project Overview

SvelteKit-based personal website with static site generation, Docker containerization, and remote deployment pipeline. Built for simplicity with comprehensive privacy/cookie consent management and production-ready infrastructure.

## Architecture & Stack

- **Framework**: SvelteKit with `@sveltejs/adapter-static` for static site generation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark theme (`bg-slate-900 text-gray-100`)
- **Build**: Vite, TypeScript, pnpm package manager
- **Deployment**: Docker + nginx, deployed to homelab via rsync + Docker Compose
- **Analytics**: Google Tag Manager with GDPR-compliant consent management

## Key Development Patterns

### Routing & Page Structure

- Uses SvelteKit file-based routing in `src/routes/`
- Global layout in `+layout.svelte` includes Footer, CookieBanner, and canonical URLs
- All pages prerendered via `export const prerender = true` in `+layout.ts`
- Error pages: `404/+page.svelte` and `50x/+page.svelte` for custom error handling

### Styling Conventions

- Consistent container pattern: `<div class="container mx-auto px-4 py-8 max-w-4xl">`
- Typography hierarchy: `text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold` for h1, `text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold` for h2
- Link styling: `font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline` with `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- Responsive text: `md:text-xl sm:text-base` pattern throughout

### Privacy & Consent Management

- Sophisticated GDPR consent system in `src/lib/components/CookieBanner.svelte`
- GTM integration with consent mode v2 in `src/lib/gtm.ts`
- Consent state managed via localStorage and dataLayer events
- Privacy settings page at `/privacy-settings` for user control

## Critical Workflows

### Local Development

```bash
pnpm dev              # Start development server
pnpm check           # Type checking and svelte-check
pnpm format          # Prettier formatting
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
pnpm prod:deploy     # Full deployment pipeline:
  # 1. pnpm prebuild  - Generates build info with git commit
  # 2. pnpm build     - SvelteKit static build
  # 3. rsync to homelab with prod.deploy.files.txt filter
  # 4. Docker Compose restart on remote server
```

### Build System

- `scripts/generate-build-info.cjs` creates `src/lib/build-info.ts` with git commit hash
- Build info displayed in Footer component for deployment tracking
- Uses `prod.compose.yml` for containerized nginx serving from `/usr/share/nginx/html`

## Infrastructure Details

### nginx Configuration (`nginx/default.conf`)

- Domain redirect: `distel.me` → `michaeldistel.com`
- Cloudflare IP trust configuration for real IP detection
- Static asset caching with `expires 1y` for immutable assets
- Comprehensive security headers including CSP, HSTS, permissions policy
- Health check endpoint at `/nginx-health` returns configuration version

### Docker Setup

- nginx:alpine base with build folder mounted as read-only
- Resource limits: 0.10 CPU, 100M memory
- External proxy network for reverse proxy integration
- Health checks via curl to nginx-health endpoint

## Component Patterns

### Shared Components (`src/lib/components/`)

- `Footer.svelte`: Displays build commit hash, copyright, privacy links
- `CookieBanner.svelte`: Complex consent management with gtag integration
- `Toast.svelte`: User notifications (referenced but check if used)

### Page Content Patterns

- Use semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy
- Section comments: `<!-- Section: Name -->`
- External links always include security attributes
- Contact sections with consistent email/social link styling

## Key Files to Reference

- `package.json`: Scripts show deployment pipeline and build process
- `src/routes/+layout.svelte`: Global layout patterns and canonical URL handling
- `src/lib/gtm.ts`: Analytics and consent management integration
- `nginx/default.conf`: Production server configuration and security setup
- `prod.compose.yml`: Containerization and deployment configuration

## Project-Specific Conventions

- All external links use `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- Build commit tracking via auto-generated `build-info.ts`
- Consistent dark theme color palette throughout
- Privacy-first approach with granular consent controls
- Mobile-responsive design with consistent breakpoint usage

When making changes, ensure they align with the existing dark theme, maintain the privacy-compliant analytics setup, and follow the established Tailwind class patterns for consistency.

## Writing and Content

You are writing as Michael Distel.

Tone

- Personal and reflective. First-person notes to self.
- Humble and non-prescriptive. Do not tell readers what to do.
- Curious and grounded. Practical over hype.
- Calm and understated. Light humour is fine (“hi Mum”).

Style

- Simple, direct sentences with plain vocabulary.
- UK/Australian spelling (kilometres, organise, colour).
- Minimise contractions (“I am”, “do not” preferred).
- Do not use em dashes; use commas or full stops.
- Prefer specifics over abstractions: dates, numbers, concrete examples.
- Keep paragraphs short and grouped by topic. Clear headings are fine if helpful.

Content focus

- VC and investment topics at the early stage: timing, founder–market fit, capital efficiency, signals vs story.
- Web3 with emphasis on testing and stablecoins as practical rails.
- Industrial automation and my VS Code extension at controlforge.dev (workflows, small utilities, testing, handover).
- Travel and slow adventures, including Kicking Miles (1,800 kilometres, 35 cities, 40 days). Rockets and the physics that make them fly. Motorbike and occasional games.

Principles

- Be honest about uncertainty. It is fine to be wrong and to revise later.
- Timestamp or note context when it matters.
- Invite conversation rather than push conclusions.

Avoid

- Imperatives, prescriptive advice, sales or marketing language, buzzwords, long metaphors, filler, and em dashes.
